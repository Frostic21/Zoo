<h1> The Grasslands.</h1>
<blockquote cite="https://kids.nationalgeographic.com/nature/habitats/article/grassland">A herd of antelope moves slowly through the tall grass. Suddenly a cheetah leaps from its hiding place,
    and the animals zig and zag across the savanna.
    They make it to a small grove of scrubby trees, but they can’t let their guard down yet.
    It’s the end of the rainy season and the antelopes—like many animals on the grasslands—must leave their protected place and migrate across open grasslands to find water.</blockquote>

<h2>Cheetahs</h2>
<p style="text-indent: 25px">Cheetahs are one of the fastest animals on earth. They are a type of cats that can reach speeds as high as 70 mph.
    Cheetahs eat small and medium-sized animals, such as hares, gazelles, and more.Their bodies are built for high speed and are also very flexible.</p>
<blockquote cite="https://kids.nationalgeographic.com/animals/mammals/facts/cheetah"> Cheetahs are famous for their tawny coats covered in black spots,
    each arranged in a unique pattern to help the animals identify one another.
    Bold black stripes streak like tears from the inner corners of their eyes down to both sides of their mouths, and the ends of their bushy tails have black rings.</blockquote>
<p>They are considered to be part of the <quote>Big Cats</quote> such as the lion and tigers. They are very fast animals and are cool animals.</p>

<h2>Prairie Dog</h2>
<p style="text-indent: 25px">Prairie Dogs are a type of rodent, contrary from its name, and live in burrows they make in the dry ground of the savannas.</p>
<blockquote cite="https://kids.nationalgeographic.com/animals/mammals/facts/prairie-dog">Up to 15 inches long, the prairie dog is related to the squirrel.
    And this mammal is all about family time.
    Prairie dog family groups, which contain up to 26 individuals, share food, groom each other, and even greet one another with nose-to-nose nuzzles.</blockquote>
<p>They are excellent diggers and usually make burrows that can cover almost half a square mile. These burrows are called dog towns. Their diets usually consists of grass and leafy vegetation.
These adorable looking rodents also have extremely great vision and hearing.</p>
