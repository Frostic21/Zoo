<h1> Rainforest Habitat.</h1>
<blockquote cite="https://kids.nationalgeographic.com/nature/habitats/article/rain-forest">A beam of sunlight makes its way through the leaves and lights up the brightly colored wings of a macaw.
    An enormous butterfly flits from plant to plant.
    Monkeys shout and chatter as they swing from tree to tree looking for breakfast. The rainforest is waking up.</blockquote>

<h2>Anaconda</h2>
<p style="text-indent: 25px">These Green Anacondas are part of the snake family. Unlike other snakes they are not venomous. They kill their prey by squeezing them until they stop breathing.</p>
<blockquote cite="https://kids.nationalgeographic.com/animals/reptiles/facts/anaconda"> The green anaconda is the largest snake in the world, when both weight and length are considered.
    It can reach a length of 30 feet (9 meters) and weigh up to 550 pounds (227 kilograms).
    To picture how big that is, if about five ten-year-olds lie down head to foot, they'd be about the length of this huge snake.</blockquote>
<p>They feed on fish, jaguars and other small animals. They can eat their prey in just on swallow! Their jaws are made of stretchy ligaments so they can open their mouth wide.</</p>

<h2>Red-Eyed Tree Frog</h2>
<p style="text-indent: 25px">These Red-Eyed critters have the ability to camouflage on leaves due to their green color.</p>
<blockquote cite="https://kids.nationalgeographic.com/animals/amphibians/facts/red-eyed-tree-frog"> The frogs have turned a striking green, with blue-and-yellow striped sides,
    orange or red feet, a flash of blue on their thighs, and big red eyes.
    The bright colors are a defense mechanism.</blockquote>
<p> They feed on small insects and they lay their eggs on a leaf that hangs over the water.</p>
