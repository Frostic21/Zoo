<h1> Ocean Habitat.</h1>
<blockquote cite="https://kids.nationalgeographic.com/nature/habitats/article/ocean">Oceans are areas of salty water that fill enormous basins on the Earthâ€™s surface.
    Even though Earth has one continuous body of saltwater, scientists and geographers divide it into five different sections.
    From biggest to smallest, they are the Pacific, the Atlantic, the Indian, the Southern, and the Arctic Oceans.</blockquote>

<h2>Great White Sharks</h2>
<p style="text-indent: 25px">Great Whites are one of the most popular type of shark. These sharks are extremely stealthy in order to catch their pey
    They usually feed on fish but they also like to feed on sea mammals like sea lions and seals.</p>
<blockquote cite="https://kids.nationalgeographic.com/animals/fish/facts/great-white-shark"> At birth a baby great white shark is already about 5 feet (1.5 meters) long;
    as it grows it may reach a length up to four times that.</blockquote>
<p>Sharks have a skeleton made out of cartridge instead of bones. When the female shark give birth to their children, their children will immediately run away as their mother might see them as prey.
These pups are usually on their own as they have to watch out for other bigger predators which also include other sharks.</p>
