<h1> Polar Habitat.</h1>
<blockquote cite="https://kids.nationalgeographic.com/nature/habitats/article/grassland">It’s frigid and you’re surrounded by ice.
    You wonder how any animal could survive in this extreme cold.
    Then a polar bear and her cubs lumber by, and in the ocean behind them a whale erupts from the water.</blockquote>

    Arctic foxes generally eat any small animal they can find like hares, birds, eggs, fish, and carrion. Their bodies are built to survive their habitats harsh conditions
</p>
<blockquote cite="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arctic_fox"> It has a large and very fluffy tail.
    ts body length ranges from 46 to 68 cm (18 to 27 in), with a generally rounded body shape to minimize the escape of body heat.</blockquote>
<p> Although arctic fox don't hibernate, they often store up fat to store more heat and to use as an energy source when food becomes scarce.</p>

<h2>Prairie Dog</h2>
<p style="text-indent: 25px">Emperor Penguins are a type of bird that live in the cold environment. Their main source of food are fish, krill, and squid.</p>
<blockquote cite="https://kids.nationalgeographic.com/animals/mammals/facts/prairie-dog">Like all penguins, it is flightless, with a streamlined body,
    and wings stiffened and flattened into flippers for a marine habitat.</blockquote>
<p>These birds are very social animals and like to fish in groups to coordinate their catches. Whenever the female lay an egg the male usually takes care of the egg
while the female goes and fish.</p>
